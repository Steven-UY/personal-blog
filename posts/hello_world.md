Hello World! This is my first "post" here if you want to say that hehe. I created this thing using Next, React, Typescript uhhh that's it? Pretty simple, I honestly need to fix a bunch of the formatting lol and also it's probably not the pretties frontend design but whatever it works I guess. I'll probably use this for occassional rants, ramblings, or whatever is really on my mind. I'm kind of forcing myself to use this so that the blog is actually populated, and I didn't just create this for nothing...

## Back in The City

The semester just started and I don't currently have an internship as a junior... It's February. Well maybe I'm cooked, but I don't know I feel like I can do it still. I recently went to HoyaHacks and was actually able to make pretty good contributions to my hackathon team. I built out the whole frontend with a little trusty help from v0 which works wonders by the way. Admittedly, I've been really cautious recently about using generative AI for code generation, but in hackathons I draw an exception whereion it's really just about speed. Doesn't matter as much what the code looks like, just make it work haha. It actually gave me a lot of confidence and also made me understand that I need to work on API integration fromm frontend to the backend which I had trouble with during the hackathon. Solidify my JavaScript, just went over async and await, promises, callbacks. God... what a drag but really interesting actually especially how JavaScript works under the hood with the event loop.

## Leetcode Why

I've been trying to get consistent with Leetcode and it's been going sorta well-ish so far. It's super draining but also kinda fun? I'm trying my best not to look at the solution and only resorting to it after I truly have run out of ideas. I spent two days on a medium array question lol and currently I am stuck on another medium array question but maybe I'll be able to do it soon. Anywho technical interviewing scares the hell out of me and that's why I'm doing leetcode. But I'm not just doing it for the sake of it, it's also very enjoyable and I think it'll complement my software developer skills who knows.

## Something funnny I found on Reddit
